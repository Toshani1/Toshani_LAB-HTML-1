            <p> Hello my name is Toshani Mukherjee! I was born in India but have been brought up in New Jersey my whole life. <br> 
                I am an only child and had a dog that shared the same birthday as me! My favorite hobby would be lego building, <br> 
                a little piece of me believes that due to that satisfaction is the reason why I am currently majoring in Architecture at NJIT. <br> 
                In middle school, I heard of a club called the Odyssey of the Mind (O.M.), a national competition where your team <br> 
                chooses out of the five different prompts, then, create a play or solution to the prompt. Due to such a club, I love keeping <br> 
                in touch with my creative side and doing so, found myself attracted to architecture. In a sense it is like giving an issue or <br> 
                criteria of a job but to spin to it and make it unique.</p>
